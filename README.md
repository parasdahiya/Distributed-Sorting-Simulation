# Distributed-Sorting-Simulation
Simulation in Java of Sasaki's algorithm for distributed sorting.

Compile and run the SasakiSimulation.java file. - Contains the main class.
The class Process extends the inbuilt Thread class. Using Process ensures that sorting on a single system actually simulates distributed sorting.
